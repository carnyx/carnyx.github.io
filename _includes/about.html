                <p class="lead">Founded in 1997 Carnyx & Co. is a charitable company which provides a unique interface between musical archaeology and the world of contemporary performance and recording. We have commissioned many new works featuring the reconstructed Deskford Carnyx, documented on seven CDs, three film sound tracks, and live performances and lectures world wide.</p>
                <p class="lead">Since 2000 Carnyx & Co has also become the parent organisation of a number of exciting ensembles and collaborative projects which continue to generate new work in the fields of contemporary and ancient music, film and theatre. The reconstruction of this iconic Celtic instrument has become the catalyst for a wave of contemporary artistic expression.</p>
                <p class="lead">As Artistic Director of Carnyx & Co, the future is full of challenge and excitement as our current projects: Trio dâ€™ART, Carnyx Brass, Tam Lin, Red Shift and HeadSpace Ensemble, perform and record new works around the world. My own solo project The Mouthpiece of The Gods continues to reach audiences of all ages and cultural backgrounds, enabling me to tell the story of the fabulous carnyx, and the evolution of the great family of lip reed instruments.</p>
