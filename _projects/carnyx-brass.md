Carnyx Brass was established in 2007, and gave their debut performance in a live performance from Glasgow Green as part of the BBC Proms in the Park, watched by a live audience of over 3,000 and broadcast nationally and internationally. Although the group expands to quintet and larger for specific projects, the core of the group is the trio of Paul Archibald, trumpet, Etienne Cutajar, horn, and John Kenny, trombone. Their mission is both to interpret the distinguished existing repertoire for brass trio, and to expand that repertoire through the commissioning of new works: their debut performance featured Balvennie Castle, commissioned by the BBC from John Kenny for trumpet, horn, and the 2000 year old Celtic war horn called a carnyx, from which the group takes its name. The trio has subsequently performed throughout Scotland, commissioning new works from Peter Longworth, Timothy Cooper, and Etienne Rolin, premiered at the 2010 Malta Festival.

The performers:

## Paul Archibald

Paul’s first appointment was as Co-Principal Trumpet in the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden working with great conductors such as Carlos Kleiber, Sir Colin Davis and Sir Georg Solti. In 1980 he relinquished this position to concentrate on work with his group, the English Brass Ensemble and to perform as a member of the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble and the London Sinfonietta. 

Throughout the 1980's Paul traveled extensively with these chamber groups, performing at many musical centres throughout the world. His enthusiasm for contemporary music was reflected in the work of the English Brass Ensemble whose focus was performing contemporary brass repertoire. The ensemble commissioned and premiered many new works and worked with leading composers such as Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Gunthur Schuller, Witold Lutoslawki and Elliott Carter.

In 1984 Paul was a prize winner at the Toulon Prix de Concours, a major international trumpet competition which laid the foundations of his career as a soloist. He has since performed the solo repertoire with many of Britain's finest orchestras including the London Philharmonic, Bournemouth Symphony, Chamber Orchestra of Europe, London Mozart Players, Britten Sinfonia and the Orchestra of St John's.

In 1995 he was appointed Principal Trumpet of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and during this period he had the opportunity to perform many of the great orchestral works. Paul is now actively involved in almost every aspect of musical performance: chamber music with Trio D'Art with John Kenny (trombone) and Helen Reid (piano), English Brass, Carnyx Brass Trio and the Fibonacci Sequence: orchestral music as a member of OSJ, Britten Sinfonia and the London Mozart Players: commercial music, having performed on many film soundtracks with icons of popular culture such as Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Bob Geldoff and duo repertoire, performing in recitals with pianist Helen Reid. 

Paul is also based in Trinidad & Tobago working as Principal Trumpet with the National Philharmonic Orchestra and as Professor of Music at the National Academy of Performing Arts, Port of Spain. He is also a member of Chaconia Brass, comprised of principal players with the National Philharmonic Orchestra of Trinidad & Tobago.

Paul also edits two series of brass music for Brass Wind Publications: the English Brass Collection consists of new works for brass ensemble and the Paul Archibald Collection consists of new additions to the solo repertoire. 

Paul also runs two brass courses throughout the year, at the Dartington International Summer School and the Benslow Music Trust. He is also the Artistic Director of Brass Classics, a recording label featuring the colourful world of the brass repertoire and its performers. His discography includes 'Joie de Vivre', 'Divertissement' and Peter Maxwell Davies’ 'Trumpet Sonata' recorded for the composers own label, Max Opus. As a conductor Paul's discography includes 'Proclamation', with the International Celebrity Trumpet Ensemble and 'Hodie Gloriosa' with the London Mozart Players Brass Ensemble
