Carnyx Brass was established in 2007, and gave their debut performance in a live performance from Glasgow Green as part of the BBC Proms in the Park, watched by a live audience of over 3,000 and broadcast nationally and internationally. Although the group expands to quintet and larger for specific projects, the core of the group is the trio of Mark O’Keefe, trumpet, Etienne Cutajar, horn, and John Kenny, trombone. Their mission is both to interpret the distinguished existing repertoire for brass trio, and to expand that repertoire through the commissioning of new works: their debut performance featured a trio commissioned by the BBC from John Kenny for trumpet, horn, and the 2000 year old Celtic war horn called a carnyx, and from which the group takes its name. 

Carnyx Brass repertoire includes trios by Francis Poulenc, Benjamin Britten, Vaclav Nelhybel, Leslie Bassett, Edwin Avril, Robert Marek, Etienne Rolin, John Kenny, and they are currently committed to commissioning music from some of Scotland’s finest younger generation composers, including Peter Longworth, Patrick Kenny, Helen Beauchamp, and Brendan Musk.



Mark O’Keefe – biography

Creative Scotland winner 2003, Mark O’Keeffe has held the post of principal trumpet with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra since December 1996. He is a native of County Cork, Ireland, where he began his musical studies at the age of seven. After playing in the local brass band and receiving trumpet lessons from his father, his love of the trumpet developed. 

Formal lessons at the Cork School of Music and the Royal Northern College of music were taken, and Mark was chosen in 1992 as the winner of the RTE Musician of the Future competition. On his return to Ireland later that year, he was appointed associate principal trumpet of the National Symphony orchestra, a post he held for four years. Over the past ten years he has appeared as soloist with the BBCSSO on a number of occasions performing new works by Judith Bingham, Mark Anthony Turnage, Thea Musgrave and Tansy Davies, as well as concertos by Telemann, Hummel and Shostakovich.

Mark has recently commissioned new solo trumpet works by Scottish composers John Maxwell Geddes, Jennifer Martin and Anthea Haddow and has performed as principal trumpet with the CBSO, LSO, Halle Orchestra and the BBC Symphony Orchestra.

In addition to his career with the BBCSSO, he is a committed chamber musician playing in several ensembles that share his passion for performing new music. His teachers have included Murray Greig, John Wallace and Bo Nilsson. 

Mark O’Keeffe teaches at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, Glasgow where he has completed, with distinction, a master degree in trumpet performance.

John Kenny was born in 1957 in Birmingham. Internationally recognised for his interpretation of contemporary music, he has performed and broadcast as a recitalist and concerto soloist in over 50 nations. John also performs jazz and early music, frequently directing his own ensembles in the UK and abroad.  As a composer, he is particularly active in collaborations with dance and theatre, and this love of theatre is often an important feature of his recital output. His past commissions have included the London Contemporary Dance Theatre, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, the International Trombone Association, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Edinburgh Contemporary Arts Trust, Chamber Group of Scotland, Dance Umbrella, St. Magnus Festival, BBC Proms in The Park, American Drama Group Europe, The New Haven International Festival of Arts and Ideas (USA) and the Festival d’ Angers, France, Vokal Nord (Norway), CCMIX Institut (France).


In 1993 John Kenny was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy of Music, and is currently a professor at both the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where he specialises in the interpretation of contemporary music and The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, where he concentrates on sackbut and the interpretation of early music. 

In 1992 John Kenny was invited to join a team of specialists at the National Museum of Scotland committed to reconstruct the Deskford Carnyx. Discovered in Northeast Scotland, this is the finest example so far discovered of an Iron Age Celtic war horn which was the most splendid and powerful wind instrument of the ancient world. In 1993 he became the first person to play the carnyx for 2000 years, and has since lectured and performed on the instrument internationally, in the concert hall, and on radio, television, and film. There are now numerous compositions for the carnyx, and it features on seven CD’s, and on March 15 2003 he performed solo to an audience of 65,000 in the Stade De France, Paris. John Kenny lives in Edinburgh with his wife and two sons.
