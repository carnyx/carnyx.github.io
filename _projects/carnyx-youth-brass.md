Carnyx Youth Brass, directed by John Kenny, is made up of students and young professional brass players who were once members of the brass ensemble of St Mary's Music School in Edinburgh. In 2014 the group recorded its first CD album, Stormchaser, combining compositions and arrangements by group members with brass classics. The individual players are currently studying or working throughout Europe, across the whole spectrum of musical periods and styles, but the group comes together to work on special projects throughout the year. 2016 will feature Peter Cowdrie's extraordinary "Sorrowful Glen", a site specific work for ten brass players and castles, and new works for brass and choir with Scott Stroman's Eclectic Voices.
