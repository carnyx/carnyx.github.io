Red Shift is one of the most exciting additions to the UK contemporary jazz
music scene for a decade: an improvising composers ensemble
containing five trombones and rhythm section. The group takes its name
from the Redshift phenomenon that is often cited as evidence for an
expanding universe - and so Red Shift seeks to introduce the exciting sonic
frequencies of the full trombones family to an ever expanding audience base.

The group includes: 

- the legendary performer Rick Taylor (Elton John, George Russell, Peat
Bog Fairies), 
- the globe trotting contemporist John Kenny (Steve Lacy, Chick Corea &
international carnyx soloist), 
- the versatile Chris Greive (Ray Charles, Scottish National Jazz Orchestra, Salsa Celtica), 
- the swinging Phil O'Malley (Scottish National Jazz Orchestra, London Jazz Orchestra, Classic
Jazz Orchestra) 
- and the powerful Patrick Kenny (Tommy Smith Youth Jazz Orchestra,
Ronak Baja Indian Fusion Band, European
Youth Jazz Orchestra).

Creating the pulsing interplay with this
supergroup are: 

- pianist Chick Lyall (Green
Room Trio, commissions for Scottish
Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Jazz Composers
Orchestra), 
- bassist Tom Lyne (Brian Kelloch,
Dave Milligan Trio, Sophie Bancroft) and
- drummer Tom Bancroft (Geri Allen, Trio AAB,
Dave Milligan Trio).

Red Shift made their debut at the Isle of Skye Jazz Festival in
October 2009 with a program featuring the music of Rick Taylor, and have since performed projects at the award winning Edinburgh Jazz Bar, featuring the music of Tony Faulkner, as well as arrangements by the be-bop king of trombone, Kai Winding, and contemporary British legend Mark Nightingale.
