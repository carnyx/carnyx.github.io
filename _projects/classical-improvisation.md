David Dolan and John Kenny, Classical Improvisation

Pianist David Dolan and trombonist John Kenny, independently pursuing international careers as soloists and chamber music players are also active improvisers. Since 2009 they have established a unique improvising duo, through which they explore a world of heightened listening, risk-taking and intense communication using the various languages of classical music as a springboard for dialogues without words. Ranging from miniatures to full scale sonatas, their improvisations lean on instantaneous response, drawing upon a huge well of their experience as concert performers. The audience is a vital part of the process, proposing themes or motives from which the duo takes off.
 
John Kenny has performed as a concert soloist and actor in over 50 nations, and is also the first modern player of the carnyx, a 2000 year old Celtic war horn. He is professor of trombone at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
 
 David Dolan has devoted his career as a concert pianist, researcher and teacher, to the revival of classical improvisation and has been including extemporizations in his solo and chamber music performances. Professor at the Yehudi Menuhin School and the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, where he is the head of the Centre for Creative Performance, his master classes are run in major music institutions worldwide.
