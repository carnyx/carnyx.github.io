Since 2002 John Kenny has collaborated as performer, composer and recording artist with The Wild Boar Press, which is a compact group of like-minded artists, led by visual artist and film-maker Sean Harris. We work in a variety of media: animation, music, storytelling, printmaking, poetry, installation, sculpture – and sometimes performances that involve the whole lot...

A collaborative ethos is central to our work. Sometimes we work for ourselves, sometimes to commission, often with communities, young and old. The act of bringing together diverse groups and individuals generates a unique creative tension and energy. This yields singular results.

Over the last few years, our main focus has been on the production of a series of animated films that reflect our multi-disciplinary approach. The results are rich, highly atmospheric and have been implanted in a variety of (often quite unconventional) contexts.

Much of what we do is founded in the exploration of society’s emotional connection with the past, through objects, landscapes and most importantly; living culture. In doing this we hope to foster a better understanding of past, present, and therefore, future lives.

Our aim is to discover the strengths of whoever we’re working with – and to integrate them purposefully into the whole clattering machine. Regardless of age, profession or status; all have a significant contribution to make.

We’re proud to have collaborated with major institutions across the world. But, at the same time, a good deal of our most rewarding work has been undertaken in village halls and small rural schools.

There are many places and ways in which the products of this unique creative fusion can exist, be used – and hopefully, be inspirational.

It’s all about the work. We put everything into the work...

Since 2005, we have worked with (amongst many others):

* Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales
* British Council
* Cadw – the Welsh Assembly Government’s historic environment service
* National Eisteddfod of Wales
* National Museum of Ireland
* National Museums Scotland
* The British Museum
* The Smithsonian Institute
* London 2012 Cultural Olympiad
* Centre for Science Communication, University of Otago, New Zealand
