## 1: Hildegard of Bingen 1098 – 1179: Spiritus sanctus vivificans vita

>Holy Spirit, quickening life,
>Moving all things, the root in all creation,
>Who washes all things of impurity,
>Removing sins and soothing wounds
>Who is shining light and laudable life,
>Waking and re-awakening all that is

Hildegard was an extraordinarily creative and diverse person spending her very long life  as  a   diplomat, writer,  abbess and musician.  She was a novitiate at the Benedictine monastery of Disibodenberg  from the  age  of eight, and later   became  the abbess  at Rupertsberg near Bingen. She saw visions throughout her life, and made a record of them in words and music. She wrote medical and natural history texts and was famed through her prophesies, becoming a correspondent and consultant  to Popes and Kings. 

Although the sackbut is 350 years too modern for Hildegard, its role was to imitate and compliment the human voice in sacred music and it is perfect for the uplifting and joyous text. 

## 2, 3, 4: John Kenny, Secret House, sonata for female trombonist.

This work originally formed the central part of a 90 minute multi-media music theatre piece called “The Secret House” involving dance, puppetry, live film manipulation, ambisonic sound projection, theatre and music, commissioned by Duff House at Banff in Scotland, and premiered there on November 16th 2000. The piece was conceived, composed and directed by myself, choreographed by Eric Tessier-Lavigne, and filmed by John McGeoch. Eight performers led an itinerant audience throughout the entire space of Duff House, an imposing baroque mansion commissioned by William Duff, Lord Braco, from the brilliant Scottish architect William Adam in 1735. Making use of stairwells, corridors, chambers, and eventually focussing on extended ballets performed in two great drawing rooms, our attempt was to examine the complex relation of human to house, as shell, shelter, prison, projection of ego - as well as exploring the huge variety of acoustics and atmospheres presented by such a magnificent structure.  These two dance theatre pieces were scored respectively for male bass trombonist with two dancers and a duo for female trombonist with female dancer. At the premier, Emily White played trombone, with ballerina Patricia Hines.

Secret House is my fifth sonata for solo trombone. I decided to score it specifically for a female performer for several reasons: firstly, there are an increasing number of girls taking up the trombone, and consequently of top class professional female trombonists world-wide. Secondly, much of the existing contemporary repertoire which makes use of vocal multiphonics has been conceived for the male voice - it can be transposed, but the resultant tone colour is very different. However, this problem is also a wonderful opportunity: the female voice used within the trombone is essentially a different instrument, with a range of pitch and timbre unavailable to the male player. This piece could be transposed by a man, but the effect would be much altered. Thirdly, the theatrical concept of this piece requires a female performer to achieve the desired psychological and emotional impact.

The music is intimately bound to the spoken word. My three poems are a response to the task of reflecting concepts of “house” as shelter, womb, and icon. The first two are integrated into the music, the third narrated unaltered - the music which follows is a reflection on the poem just as the poem is an historic and personal reflection. The trombonist must speak, sing, play various percussion instruments, and make dramatic use of space and physical gesture - a considerable challenge. It should also be remembered that whilst Secret House was always intended to stand as a recital solo, it was originally conceived as a duo with dancer. The choreography of Eric Tessier-Lavigne transported the piece onto a different plane, and it is my hope that it may also be reinterpreted in this form in the future. Secret House is dedicated to Emily White

## 5: John Kenny: Intrada for Bass Trombone 
This short piece is extracted from my 90 minute setting of the Book of Revelation, “Das A und das O” for trombone, organ, percussion and narrator commissioned by the Landshut Festival in Bavaria, and premiered at the Landshut Auferstehungskirche in December 2005, performed by Michael Büttler, trombone, Georg Rothenaicre, organ, and myself as narrator. This music forms the dramatic entrance of the 4th Horseman of the Apocalypse.


## 6,7,8: John Kenny: Sonata for Unaccompanied Bass Trombone

Having previously written sonatas for unaccompanied tenor and alto trombones, it was a logical progression to write one for the bass trombone. Many of the finest professional trombonists I have known have been bass players, and as a teacher I am continually meeting highly talented young exponents of the instrument - yet, sadly, whilst the solo repertoire for tenor trombone has expanded enormously over the past 30 years, there is still very little challenging solo material which is truly idiomatic for the bass trombone.  There are wonderful players who need music to interpret: a new generation of bass trombonists should have the opportunity to explore their potential as concert soloists and composers need to be encouraged to write for this exciting medium. The available palette of sounds and techniques specific to the bass trombone need to be more widely explored: this piece, and its sister piece On Bamburgh Beach, are my own first contributions to that effort.

The Sonata is in three movements; the 1st begins with a sequence of notes derived from the shape of the trombone itself - that is, by moving the slide at a slow, regular pace from fully closed to full extension and back, and allowing the embouchure to fall onto notes in a comfortable relaxation/tension cycle. This 22 note pattern is used at first with great freedom, becoming increasingly structured into a melodic theme, with a series of commentaries. The availability of two independently operated valves offers the possibility of a multiplicity of glissandi, breath effects, and multiphonics far beyond those of the tenor or alto trombones, and there is a preliminary exploration of these sounds before the opening sequence returns, leading to a brief coda.

The 2nd movement begins and ends with a gentle, dreamy melody, followed by a first dip into the world of lip multiphonics, before a bolero of sorts takes over. The player moves in and out of a derby hat mute on a stand, trying to achieve the effect of a split personality: bass vamp and lead voice. The upper voice becomes increasingly wild, with its partner plodding steadily on beneath, until a point of exhaustion demands a change of direction - achieved by a more complex exploration of lip multiphonics over different valve combinations. The opening theme returns, this time distorted both by continual valve trills of microtonal intervals, and by moving in and out of the hat mute in waves.

The 3rd movement makes considerable use of breath sounds, both in vowel and consonant forms. Elegiac in intent, it seems to be harking back to something, but exactly what is hazy: is there a longing for the conventional sound of the trombone, for the meaning behind the wordless speech-sounds, or for the musical styles of a bygone era? There are references to all three ideas, interrupted by a brief but violent jazz based episode; but the movement closes with a gentle falling melody projected backwards through the empty tuning slide of one section of valve tubing, rather than forward through the bell.

The piece was begun of August 11 1999, the day on which southern England experienced a total solar eclipse, and completed on September 22nd. It was commissioned jointly by the British Trombone Society, International Trombone Association, and Warwick Music.

# 9 & 10: Peter Cowdrey, two duos for two trombones Irish air with Songthrush and Wrens

All human beings have experienced birdsong directly or indirectly. It probably influenced the development of language, as songbirds and humans, along with humpback whales, are almost the only animals who choose individualised improvisation in place of genetically encoded vocalisations. Recent technology has enabled us to slow down the sounds to speeds and pitches at which we can appreciate the true essence and subtlety of birdsong. A bird's ear is tuned to be aware of all of this detail, so slowing down birdsong to the pitch of human instruments gives us an awareness of what a bird must hear. It also provides a wealth of wonderful bird-generated raw material to compose with. Trombones are particularly suitable, as their ability to slide between pitches regardless of frets, valves or keys, is shared with birds. 

Irish Air with Song Thrush was premiered at Dartington, and contrasts human and bird-generated song. Wrens is based on fairly strict transcriptions of slowed down songs of wren species from Japan, Colombia and the UK. It was originally for violin and piccolo, part of a larger encyclopaedia of pieces based on fragments of slowed down birdsong, so further slowing down and dropping of pitch was necessary for trombones. 
In Irish air with Song Thrush the bird generated lines were specifically adapted to be played comfortably on trombones, whereas in Wrens the instruments have to adapt to the details of the birdsongs, regardless of technical challenges.

Peter Cowdrey’s works have been premiered at Istanbul and Schleswig Holstein Festivals, the Royal Albert Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Purcell Room. A recent commission was premiered by the BBC Concert Orchestra in Bucharest in October 2016, and Recovered Voices, a song cycle based of transcriptions of the recorded voices of Gumilev, Mandelstam, Akhmatova and Pasternak, was premiered at the 2016 Moffat Russian Conference. He has written music for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

In 2010, he conducted the premiere of his one act opera The Lovely Ladies at Christies. This production was repeated at the Buxton Opera Festival in 2011. In November 2011 The Mad Duchess was premiered at Boughton House in Northamptonshire.

Many of Peter's compositions are inspired by birdsong; in 2009 he founded the ensemble The Conference of Birds. He founded a charitable initiative, Planet Birdsong, which promotes education and global communication through birdsong www.planetbirdsong.org With his sister Liz Peter leads Birdsong and Music Walking tours at Finca Buenvino in Andalucia. He has also led tours in Tuscany for ATG Travel.

# 11: Etienne Rolin, Caccia for tenor & bass trombone duo.

Harking back to an old renaissance form of imitative counterpoint as well as to the etymological sense of the Latin word “a hunt", my duo for tenor and bass trombone underlines both those qualities. The hunting aspect is somewhat of a chase after one another as well as after one's one musical shadow and discovering jazz phrasings and cross rhythms as if a devil emerged from darkness of the trombones’ low registers and was grabbed by the tail. Through the use of the voice and extended techniques, the exchanging parts give an aural impression of more than two players interacting. Caccia was written for the boisterous and genuinely stimulating partnership of John Kenny and David Taylor. In this recorded version, Emily White's female vocal harmonics add an even wider register and chromatic spectrum to the interpretation.


Etienne Rolin is a French -American composer, woodwind improvisor Soundpainting-conductor, and teacher born in California in 1952. He has written over 1000 works for all genres solo chamber music orchestra, opera and big band jazz. A large work was commissioned by the Ensemble Intercontemporain of Pierre Boulez. He performs often on basset horn and alto flute with contemporary and jazz groups in Europe such as
Tribal Klarinet Trio with German clarinettist Theo Jorgensmann, and the Phoenix Four wind trio with live electronics. He uses the soundpainting sign language to direct real time composition such as his multi disciplinary chamber opera 3D cave.

Etienne Rolin’s professional career started performing electric guitar for the U.S. premier of the rock opera“Tommy” by the WHO in 1970. He subsequently moved to France to pursue studies in Harmony and Analysis with Nadia Boulanger. Other influences in composition were Olivier Messiaen Iannis Xenakis and Franco Donatoni. Etienne Rolin has taught classical music theory, analysis, music history, jazz theory, chamber music and soundpainting at the Bordeaux Conservatory since 1985 to the present day. He is involved in many multi-media projects using employing both his own paintings and literary productions for performance. He has written three books on Improvisation and Interdisciplinary practices. For information on the full scope of Rolin’s work, visit: www.etiennerolin.com

## DVD: Secret House

Whilst working on the original live production of “Secret House” in 2000, filmmaker John McGeoch shot many hours of footage of the rehearsal process, and of the interior and exterior environments of Duff House in Banff, as well as lots of local locations connected to the history of that extraordinary place. Some of this was used as live projection during the final performance, but it was always my intention that a separate artwork should be made using sections of the music and visual material. This is neither a documentary nor a narrative film – it uses material from the live performance, but this is blended with many other images and also with new music, composed during a period as composer in residence to the Glenfiddich Distillery in Dufftown in 2007. This was very appropriate because Glenfiddich had been a major contributor to the reconstruction of the Deskford Carnyx in the early ‘90’s, and the carnyx plays a central role in this film, as well as in the 2000 live show. Furthermore, Glenfiddich’s Dufftown site is intimately linked to the same family who named both the house and the town, and the carnyx was discovered just a few miles away in 1816. Hidden, ruined and overgrown in the grounds of the modern distillery, is the cottage which belonged to the original William Grant, founder of the world’s most famous malt whisky – and also the 12th Century castle which belonged to the previous landowners. So in the same location we have echoes and artefacts from the Picts, Vikings, Normans, Scots – and the modern whisky trail. This was blended with footage of my own family home in Donegal, Ireland. Shadows, echoes of the past and present, kaleidoscopes of colour and movement, performance in unlikely places, ancient woods and the sea. There is no narrative in this film – but there are lots of stories!
